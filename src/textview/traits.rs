//! Various traits used for NSTextViews.

use crate::textview::TextView;

/// This trait can be used for implementing custom View behavior. You implement this trait on your
/// struct, and wrap your struct in a `View` or `ViewController`. The view or controller then
/// handles interfacing between your struct and system events.
///
/// It winds up feeling to subclassing, without the ability to subclass multiple levels deep and
/// get ultra confusing.

    /// Used to cache subclass creations on the Objective-C side.
    /// You can just set this to be the name of your view type. This
    /// value *must* be unique per-type.

    /// store and use repeatedly, but it's not thread safe - any UI calls must be made from the
    /// main thread!
